# Hello! Welcome to my github profile :)

Hey there, I'm Riccardo Cafagna, a computer science enthusiast with a passion for all things tech. I'm on a quest to dive deeper into open source projects and even explore a few of my own. Feel free to drop me a line ‚Äì I'm always up for a chat or some coding adventures! üòÑüë®‚Äçüíª

I like to explore different languages, frameworks, engines, databases and see what each one have to offer. Those are the main tech I've worked with and I really liked to.

## Personal Project

After Unity's introduction of a new monetization model, I made the decision to dive into OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, and more in order to develop my own game engine. It may not end up being a generic engine but rather tailored for specific game projects, and I anticipate it will be an enjoyable journey.

I've chosen to begin my OpenGL learning journey with TheCherno's YouTube channel, and I must say, it's proving to be quite challenging as it involves a different approach to coding. Nevertheless, understanding how it all works is incredibly exciting!

In addition to game development, I occasionally work on small web app projects. For these, I use Svelte along with Tailwind CSS, and I'm also exploring Go for the backend, although I haven't delved too deeply into it just yet.
